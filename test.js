//~ Todays lecture notes:

//? Topic 1: String

//! There are many data types in the python. like
//* - Numeric Data types( includes int , float etc)
//* - Sequence Data Types(string,list,tuple etc)
//* - MApping Data Types(Dist, Pair etc)
//* - Boolean Data Types , and many more types other.

//~ String Data Type:

//* we can define the string by three ways
//? - Single Quote
//?- Double Quote
//? - Triple Quote

//! There is problem in using the Single as well Double Quote as well
//? - We cant put the Double quote in the single quote, Similarly cant put single quote in the double quote
//? - Also in the single and double quote , we cant make the multiple lines like in Paragraph we see.

//* Benefit of the Triple quote is that we can put single quote , double quote and Multiline as well we can put in it.

//~ String Concatenation Methods:
//? 1. Operators.
//? 2. Formatter
//? 3. F String

//* Operator:
//?  For this method we use (+) plus operator for the string Concatenation.
//? - operator1:str + operator:str

//* String Formatter:
//? For this method we used format operator for the string concatenations
//? "{operator1} value etc in string".format()

//* F String:
//? This is the most modern way for the string concatenations
//? f"{variable} string value"


//~ Scopes in the Python:
//? there are Different scopes in the python.
//? - Local scope
//? - Global scope
//? - Enclosing scope(non local)
//? - Built-in scope

//* Global scope:
//? - This scope is used for the global variables.
//? - We can access the global variable from any where in the python program.
//? - We can change the global variable from any where in the python program.

//* Local Scope:
//? - This scope is used for the local variables.
//? - We can access the local variable from the same function where it is declared.
//? This is used in the Functions.

//* Enclosed or non local scope:
//? This scope variables are used in the nested function(function inside another function)
//? - We can access the enclosed variable from the nested function where it is declared.

//* Built-in scope:
//? - This scope is used for the built-in variables.
//? - We can access the built-in variable from any where in the python program.
//? - We can change the built-in variable from any where in the python program.

//~ Functions in python:
//? - A function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of your program.
//? - It is a way to group a set of statements together to perform a specific task.

//* - Syntax:
//? def function_name(parameters):
//* statements
//* return statement
//* if statement
//* loop statement
//* else statement
//* function call

//? - Parameters:
//* These are the variables that are passed to the function when it is called.
//* They are used to pass data to the function.


//? Arguments:
//* These are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called.
//* They are used to get the data from the function.

//? Return Value:
//* This is the value that is returned by the function when it is called.
